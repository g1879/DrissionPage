# ‚òÄÔ∏è Features and highlights

## üéá Powerful self-developed kernel

This library uses a fully self-developed kernel with numerous built-in practical functions, and integrates and optimizes common functions. Compared with selenium, it has the following advantages:

- Not based on webdriver
- No need to download different drivers for different versions of browsers
- Run faster
- Elements can be found across iframe without cutting in and out
- Think of the iframe as a normal element for clearer logic
- Can operate multiple tabs at the same time without switching
- Can directly read the browser cache to save the image, no need to use the GUI click save
- Can take a screenshot of the entire web page, including the parts outside the viewport
- Can handle shadow-root in non-open state

## üéá Highlight function

In addition to the above advantages, the library also has numerous built-in user-friendly designs.

- Minimal positioning syntax, easier to find elements
- Integrate a large number of common functions, the code is more elegant, powerful and stable
- Ubiquitous waiting and automatic retries make unstable networks easier to control, programs more stable, and writing easier
- Provide powerful download tools, operating the browser can also enjoy fast and reliable download function
- Allows repeated use of an already open browser, without having to start the browser from scratch every time you run, easy debugging
- Use the ini file to save common configurations and automatically invoke them, providing convenient Settings and avoiding complicated configuration items
- Built-in lxml as a parsing engine, the parsing speed is improved by several orders of magnitude
- Packaged with POM mode, it can be used directly for testing and easy to expand
- Highly integrated convenience features, reflected in every detail
- There are many details, not listed here, welcome to practical use experience: D
