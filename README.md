# Introduction

***

DrissionPage, a combination of driver and session, is a python- based Web automation operation integration tool.  
It achieves seamless switching between selenium and requests.  
Therefore, the convenience of selenium and the high efficiency of requests can be balanced.  
It integrates the common functions of the page, the API of the two modes is consistent, and it is easy to use.  
It uses the POM mode to encapsulate the commonly used methods of page elements, which is very suitable for automatic operation function expansion.  
What's even better is that its usage is very concise and user- friendly, with a small amount of code and friendly to novices.

# Concept and background

***

## Idea

**Concise, easy to use, extensible**



## Background

When the requests crawler faces the website to be logged in, it has to analyze data packets and JS source code, construct complex requests, and often has to deal with anti- climbing methods such as verification codes, JS confusion, and signature parameters, which has a high threshold. If the data is generated by JS calculation, the calculation process must be reproduced. The experience is not good and the development efficiency is not high.  
Using selenium, these pits can be bypassed to a large extent, but selenium is not efficient. Therefore, this library combines selenium and requests into one, switches the corresponding mode when different needs, and provides a user- friendly method to improve development and operation efficiency.  
In addition to merging the two, the library also encapsulates common functions in web pages, simplifies selenium's operations and statements. When used for web page automation, it reduces the consideration of details, focuses on function implementation, and makes it more convenient to use.  
Keep everything simple, try to provide simple and direct usage, and be more friendly to novices.

# Features

## Drission Class

Manage the WebDriver object and Session object responsible for communicating with the web page, which is equivalent to the role of the driver.

## MixPage Class

MixPage encapsulates the common functions of page operation. It calls the driver managed in the Drission class to access and operate the page. Can switch between driver and session mode. The login status will be automatically synchronized when switching.

## DriverElement class

The page element class in driver mode can perform operations such as clicking on the element, inputting text, modifying attributes, running js, etc., and can also search for descendant elements at its lower level.

## SessionElement Class

The page element class in session mode can obtain element attribute values and search for descendant elements at its lower levels.

# Simple demo

## Comparison with selenium code

The following code implements exactly the same function, compare the amount of code between the two:

- Use explicit waiting to find all elements that contain some text

```python
# Use selenium:
element = WebDriverWait(driver).until(ec.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.XPATH,'//*[contains(text(), "some text")]')))

# Use DrissionPage:
element = page('some text')
```



- Jump to the first tab

```python
# Use selenium:
driver.switch_to.window(driver.window_handles[0])

# Use DrissionPage:
page.to_tab(0)
```



- Select drop- down list by text

```python
# Use selenium:
from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select
select_element = Select(element)
select_element.select_by_visible_text('text')

# Use DrissionPage:
element.select('text')
```



- Drag and drop an element

```python
# Use selenium:
ActionChains(driver).drag_and_drop(ele1, ele2).perform()

# Use DrissionPage:
ele1.drag_to(ele2)
```



- Scroll the window to the bottom (keep the horizontal scroll bar unchanged)

```python
# Use selenium:
driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(document.documentElement.scrollLeft, document.body.scrollHeight);")

# Use DrissionPage:
page.scroll_to('bottom')
```



- Set headless mode

```python
# Use selenium:
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("- - headless")

# Use DrissionPage:
set_headless()
```



- Get pseudo element content

```python
# Use selenium:
text = webdriver.execute_script('return window.getComputedStyle(arguments[0], "::after").getPropertyValue("content");', element)

# Use DrissionPage:
text = element.after
```



- Get shadow- root

```python
# Use selenium:
shadow_element = webdriver.execute_script('return arguments[0].shadowRoot', element)

# Use DrissionPage:
shadow_element = element.shadow_root
```



- Use xpath to get attributes or nodes

```python
# Use selenium:
The usage is not supported

# Use DrissionPage:
class_name = element('xpath://div[@id="div_id"]/@class')
text = element('xpath://div[@id="div_id"]/text()[2]')
```



## Compare with requests code

The following code implements exactly the same function, compare the amount of code between the two:

- Get element content

```python
url ='https://baike.baidu.com/item/python'

# Use requests:
from lxml import etree
headers = {'User- Agent':'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.118 Safari/537.36'}
response = requests.get(url, headers = headers)
html = etree.HTML(response.text)
element = html.xpath('//h1')[0]
title = element.text

# Use DrissionPage:
page = MixPage('s')
page.get(url)
title = page('tag:h1').text
```

Tips: DrissionPage comes with default headers



-  download file

```python
url ='https://www.baidu.com/img/flexible/logo/pc/result.png'
save_path = r'C:\download'

# Use requests:
r = requests.get(url)
with open(f'{save_path}\\img.png','wb') as fd:
   for chunk in r.iter_content():
       fd.write(chunk)
        
# Use DrissionPage:
page.download(url, save_path,'img')  # Support renaming and handle file name conflicts
```



## Mode switch

Log in to the website with selenium, and then switch to requests to read the web page. Both will share login information.

```python
page = MixPage()  # Create page object, default driver mode
page.get('https://gitee.com/profile')  # Visit the personal center page (not logged in, redirect to the login page)

page.ele('@id:user_login').input('your_user_name')  # Use selenium to enter the account password to log in
page.ele('@id:user_password').input('your_password\n')

page.change_mode()  # Switch to session mode
print('Title after login:', page.title,'\n')  # session mode output after login
```

Output:

```
Title after login: Personal Information- Code Cloud Gitee.com
```



## Get and print element attributes

```python
# Connect the previous code
foot = page.ele('@id:footer- left')  # find element by id
first_col = foot.ele('css:>div')  # Use the css selector to find the element in the lower level of the element (the first one)
lnk = first_col.ele('text: Command Learning')  # Use text content to find elements
text = lnk.text  # Get element text
href = lnk.attr('href')  # Get element attribute value

print(text, href,'\n')

# Concise mode series search
text = page('@id:footer- left')('css:>div')('text:command learning').text
print(text)
```

Output:

```
Git command learning https://oschina.gitee.io/learn- git- branching/

Git command learning
```



## download file

```python
url ='https://www.baidu.com/img/flexible/logo/pc/result.png'
save_path = r'C:\download'
page.download(url, save_path)
```



# Installation

***

```
pip install DrissionPage
```
Only supports python3.6 and above, and the driver mode currently only supports chrome.
To use the driver mode, you must download chrome and **corresponding version** of chromedriver. [[chromedriver download]](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
It has only been tested in the Windows environment.

# Instructions

***

## Import module

```python
from DrissionPage import *
```



## Initialization

If you only use session mode, you can skip this section.

Before using selenium, you must configure the path of chrome.exe and chromedriver.exe and ensure that their versions match.

There are three ways to configure the path:
- Write two paths to system variables.
- Manually pass in the path when in use.
- Write the path to the ini file of this library (recommended).

If you choose the third method, please run these lines of code before using this library for the first time and record these two paths in the ini file.

```python
from DrissionPage.easy_set import set_paths
driver_path ='D:\\chrome\\chromedriver.exe'  # Your chromedriver.exe path, optional
chrome_path ='D:\\chrome\\chrome.exe'  # Your chrome.exe path, optional
set_paths(driver_path, chrome_path)
```

This method also checks whether the chrome and chromedriver versions match, and displays:

```
The version matches and can be used normally.

# Or

Abnormal:
Message: session not created: Chrome version must be between 70 and 73
  (Driver info: chromedriver=73.0.3683.68 (47787ec04b6e38e22703e856e101e840b65afe72),platform=Windows NT 10.0.19631 x86_64)
chromedriver download URL: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
```

After passing the check, you can use the driver mode normally.

In addition to the above two paths, this method can also set the following paths:

```python
debugger_address  # Debug browser address, such as: 127.0.0.1:9222
download_path  # Download file path
global_tmp_path  # Temporary folder path
user_data_path  # User data path
cache_path  # cache path
```

Tips:

- Different projects may require different versions of chrome and chromedriver. You can also save multiple ini files and use them as needed.
- It is recommended to use the green version of chrome, and manually set the path, to avoid browser upgrades causing mismatch with the chromedriver version.
- It is recommended to set the debugger_address when debugging the project and use the manually opened browser to debug, saving time and effort.



## Create drive object Drission

The creation step is not necessary. If you want to get started quickly, you can skip this section. The MixPage object will automatically create the object.

Drission objects are used to manage driver and session objects. When multiple pages work together, the Drission object is used to pass the driver, so that multiple page classes can control the same browser or Session object.
The configuration information of the ini file can be directly read and created, or the configuration information can be passed in during initialization.

```python
# Create from the default ini file
drission = Drission()

# Create by other ini files
drission = Drission(ini_path ='D:\\settings.ini')

# Create without ini files
drission = Drission(read_file = False)
```

To manually pass in the configuration:

```python
# Create with the incoming configuration information (ignore the ini file)
from DrissionPage.config import DriverOptions

# Create a driver configuration object, read_file = False means not to read the ini file
do = DriverOptions(read_file = False)

# Set the path, if it has been set in the system variable, it can be ignored
do.set_paths(chrome_path ='D:\\chrome\\chrome.exe',
              driver_path ='D:\\chrome\\chromedriver.exe')

# Settings for s mode
session_options = {'headers': {'User-Agent':'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6)'}}

# Incoming configuration, driver_options and session_options are optional, you need to use the corresponding mode to pass in
drission = Drission(driver_options, session_options)
```



## Use page object MixPage

The MixPage page object encapsulates common web page operations and realizes the switch between driver and session modes.
MixPage must receive a Drission object and use the driver or session in it. If it is not passed in, MixPage will create a Drission by itself (using the configuration of the default ini file).

Tips: When multiple page objects work together, remember to manually create a Drission object and pass it to the page object for use. Otherwise, the page objects will each create their own Drission objects, making the information unable to pass.

### Create Object

There are three ways to create objects: simple, passing in Drission objects, and passing in configuration. Can be selected according to actual needs.

```python
# Simple creation method, automatically create Drission objects with ini file default configuration
page = MixPage()
page = MixPage('s')

# Create by passing in the Drission object
page = MixPage(drission)
page = MixPage(drission, mode='s', timeout=5)  # session mode, waiting time is 5 seconds (default 10 seconds)

# Create with incoming configuration information
page = MixPage(driver_options=DriverOption, session_options=SessionOption)  # default d mode
```



### visit website

If there is an error in the connection, the program will automatically retry twice. The number of retries and the waiting interval can be specified.

```python
# Default mode
page.get(url)
page.post(url, data, **kwargs)  # Only session mode has post method

# Specify the number of retries and interval
page.get(url, retry=5, interval=0.5)
```



### Switch mode

Switch between s and d modes, the cookies and the URL you are visiting will be automatically synchronized when switching.

```python
page.change_mode(go=False)  # If go is False, it means that the url is not redirected
```



### Page properties

```python
page.url  # currently visited url
page.mode  # current mode
page.drission  # Dirssion object currently in use
page.driver  # WebDirver object currently in use
page.session  # Session object currently in use
page.cookies  # Get cookies information
page.html  # Page source code
page.title  # Current page title

# d mode unique:

page.tab_handles  # Return to the handle list of all tabs
page.current_tab_num  # Return the serial number of the current tab page
page.current_tab_handle  # Return to the current tab page handle
```



### Page operation

When calling a method that only belongs to d mode, it will automatically switch to d mode. See APIs for detailed usage.

```python
page.change_mode()  # switch mode
page.cookies_to_session()  # Copy cookies from WebDriver object to Session object
page.cookies_to_driver()  # Copy cookies from Session object to WebDriver object
page.get(url, retry, interval, **kwargs)  # Use get to access the web page, you can specify the number of retries and the interval
page.ele(loc_or_ele, timeout)  # Get the first element, node or attribute that meets the conditions
page.eles(loc_or_ele, timeout)  # Get all eligible elements, nodes or attributes
page.download(url, save_path, rename, file_exists, **kwargs)  # download file
page.close_driver()  # Close the WebDriver object
page.close_session()  # Close the Session object

# s mode unique:

# d mode unique:
page.wait_ele(loc_or_ele, mode, timeout)  # Wait for the element to be deleted, displayed, and hidden from the dom
page.run_script(js, *args)  # Run js statement
page.create_tab(url)  # Create and locate a tab page, which is at the end
page.to_tab(num_or_handle)  # Jump to tab page

page.check_page()  # Check whether the page meets expectations
page.chrome_downloading()  # Get the list of files that chrome is downloading
page.process_alert(mode, text)  # Process the prompt box
```



## Find element

ele() returns the first eligible element, and eles() returns a list of all eligible elements.
You can use these two functions under the page object or element object to find subordinate elements.

page.eles() and element.eles() search and return a list of all elements that meet the conditions.

Description:

- The element search timeout is 10 seconds by default, you can also set it as needed.

- In the following search statement, the colon: indicates a fuzzy match, and the equal sign = indicates an exact match

- There are five types of query strings: @attribute name, tag, text, xpath, and css

```python
# Find by attribute
page.ele('@id:ele_id', timeout = 2)  # Find the element whose id is ele_id and set the waiting time for 2 seconds
page.eles('@class')  # Find all elements with class attribute
page.eles('@class:class_name')  # Find all elements that have ele_class in class
page.eles('@class=class_name')  # Find all elements whose class is equal to ele_class

# Find by tag name
page.ele('tag:li')  # Find the first li element
page.eles('tag:li')  # Find all li elements

# Find according to tag name and attributes
page.ele('tag:div@class=div_class')  # Find the div element whose class is div_class
page.ele('tag:div@class:ele_class')  # Find div elements whose class contains ele_class
page.ele('tag:div@class=ele_class')  # Find div elements whose class is equal to ele_class
page.ele('tag:div@text():search_text')  # Find div elements whose text contains search_text
page.ele('tag:div@text()=search_text')  # Find the div element whose text is equal to search_text

# Find according to text content
page.ele('search text')  # find the element containing the incoming text
page.eles('text:search text')  # If the text starts with @, tag:, css:, xpath:, text:, add text: in front to avoid conflicts
page.eles('text=search text')  # The text is equal to the element of search_text

# Find according to xpath or css selector
page.eles('xpath://div[@class="ele_class"]')
page.eles('css:div.ele_class')

# Find according to loc
loc1 = By.ID,'ele_id'
loc2 = By.XPATH,'//div[@class="ele_class"]'
page.ele(loc1)
page.ele(loc2)

# Find lower- level elements
element = page.ele('@id:ele_id')
element.ele('@class:class_name')  # Find the first element whose class is ele_class at the lower level of element
element.eles('tag:li')  # find all li elements under ele_id

# Find by location
element.parent  # parent element
element.next  # next sibling element
element.prev  # previous sibling element

# Get shadow- dom, only support open shadow- root
ele1 = element.shadow_root.ele('tag:div')

# Chain search
page.ele('@id:ele_id').ele('tag:div').next.ele('some text').eles('tag:a')

# Simplified writing
eles = page('@id:ele_id')('tag:div').next('some text').eles('tag:a')
ele2 = ele1('tag:li').next('some text')
```



## Get element attributes

```python
element.html  # Return element outerHTML
element.inner_html  # Return element innerHTML
element.tag  # Return element tag name
element.text  # Return element innerText value
element.link  # Returns absolute href or src value of the element.
element.texts()  # Returns the text of all direct child nodes in the element, including elements and text nodes, you can specify to return only text nodes
element.attrs  # Return a dictionary of all attributes of the element
element.attr(attr)  # Return the value of the specified attribute of the element
element.css_path  # Return the absolute css path of the element
element.xpath  # Return the absolute xpath path of the element
element.parent  # Return element parent element
element.next  # Return the next sibling element of the element
element.prev  # Return the previous sibling element of the element
element.parents(num)  # Return the numth parent element
element.nexts(num, mode)  # Return the following elements or nodes
element.prevs(num, mode)  # Return the first few elements or nodes
element.ele(loc_or_str, timeout)  # Return the first sub- element, attribute or node text of the current element that meets the conditions
element.eles(loc_or_str, timeout)  # Return all eligible sub- elements, attributes or node texts of the current element

# d mode unique:
element.before  # Get pseudo element before content

element.size  # Get element size
element.location  # Get element location
element.shadow_root  # Get the ShadowRoot element under the element
element.get_style_property(style, pseudo_ele)  # Get element style attribute value, can get pseudo element
element.is_selected()  # Returns whether the element is selected
element.is_enabled()  # Returns whether the element is available
element.is_displayed()  # Returns whether the element is visible
```



## Element operation

Element operation is unique to d mode. Calling the following method will automatically switch to d mode.

```python
element.click(by_js)  # Click the element, you can choose whether to click with js
element.input(value)  # input text
element.run_script(js)  # Run JavaScript script on the element
element.submit()  # Submit
element.clear()  # Clear the element
element.screenshot(path, filename)  # Take a screenshot of the element
element.select(text)  # Select the drop- down list based on the text
element.set_attr(attr, value)  # Set element attribute value
element.drag(x, y, speed, shake)  # Drag the relative distance of the element, you can set the speed and whether to shake randomly
element.drag_to(ele_or_loc, speed, shake)  # Drag the element to another element or a certain coordinate, you can set the speed and whether to shake randomly
element.hover()  # Hover the mouse over the element
```



## Docking with selenium code

The DrissionPage code can be seamlessly spliced ​​with the selenium code, either directly using the selenium WebDriver object, or using its own WebDriver everywhere for the selenium code. Make the migration of existing projects very convenient.

### selenium to DrissionPage

```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://www.baidu.com')

page = MixPage(Drission(driver))  # Pass the driver to Drission, create a MixPage object
print(page.title)  # Print result: You will know by clicking on Baidu
```



### DrissionPage to selenium

```python
page = MixPage()
page.get('https://www.baidu.com')

driver = page.driver  # Get the WebDriver object from the MixPage object
print(driver.title)  # Print results: You will know by clicking on Baidu
```



## download file

Selenium lacks effective management of browser download files, and it is difficult to detect download status, rename, and fail management.
Using requests to download files can better achieve the above functions, but the code is more cumbersome.
Therefore, DrissionPage encapsulates the download method and integrates the advantages of the two. You can obtain login information from selenium and download it with requests.
To make up for the shortcomings of selenium, make the download simple and efficient.

### Features

- Specify download path
- Rename the file without filling in the extension, the program will automatically add
- When there is a file with the same name, you can choose to rename, overwrite, skip, etc.
- Show download progress
- Support post method
- Support custom connection parameters

### Demo

```python
url ='https://www.baidu.com/img/flexible/logo/pc/result.png'  # file url
save_path = r'C:\download'  # save path

# Rename to img.png, and automatically add a serial number to the end of the file name when there is a duplicate name to display the download progress
page.download(url, save_path,'img','rename', show_msg=True)
```




## Chrome Quick Settings

The configuration of chrome is very cumbersome. In order to simplify the use, this library provides setting methods for common configurations.

### DriverOptions Object

The DriverOptions object inherits from the Options object of selenium.webdriver.chrome.options, and the following methods are added to it:

```python
remove_argument(value)  # delete an argument value
remove_experimental_option(key)  # delete an experimental_option setting
remove_all_extensions()  # Remove all plugins
save()  # Save the configuration to the default ini file
save('D:\\settings.ini')  # save to other path
set_argument(arg, value)  # set argument attribute
set_headless(on_off)  # Set whether to use no interface mode
set_no_imgs(on_off)  # Set whether to load images
set_no_js(on_off)  # Set whether to disable js
set_mute(on_off)  # Set whether to mute
set_user_agent(user_agent)  # set user agent
set_proxy(proxy)  # set proxy address
set_paths(driver_path, chrome_path, debugger_address, download_path, user_data_path, cache_path)  # Set browser- related paths
```



### Instructions

```python
do = DriverOptions(read_file=False)  # Create chrome configuration object, not read from ini file
do.set_headless(False)  # show the browser interface
do.set_no_imgs(True)  # Do not load pictures
do.set_paths(driver_path='D:\\chromedriver.exe', chrome_path='D:\\chrome.exe')  # set path
do.set_headless(False).set_no_imgs(True)  # Support chain operation

drission = Drission(driver_options=do)  # Create Drission object with configuration object
page = MixPage(drission)  # Create a MixPage object with Drission object

do.save()  # Save the configuration to the default ini file
```



## Save configuration

Because there are many configurations of chrome and headers, an ini file is set up specifically to save common configurations. You can use the OptionsManager object to get and save the configuration, and use the DriverOptions object to modify the chrome configuration. You can also save multiple ini files and call them according to different projects.

Tips: It is recommended to save the commonly used configuration files to another path to prevent the configuration from being reset when the library is upgraded.

### ini file content

The ini file has three parts by default: paths, chrome_options, and session_options. The initial content is as follows.

```ini
[paths]
; chromedriver.exe path
chromedriver_path =
; Temporary folder path, used to save screenshots, file downloads, etc.
global_tmp_path =

[chrome_options]
; The address and port of the opened browser, such as 127.0.0.1:9222
debugger_address =
; chrome.exe path
binary_location =
; Configuration information
arguments = [
            ; Hide browser window
            '- - headless',
            ; Mute
            '- - mute- audio',
            ; No sandbox
            '- - no- sandbox',
            ; Google documentation mentions that this attribute needs to be added to avoid bugs
            '- - disable- gpu',
            ; Ignore warning
            'ignore- certificate- errors',
            ; Do not display the information bar
            '- - disable- infobars'
            ]
; Plugin
extensions = []
; Experimental configuration
experimental_options = {
                       'prefs': {
                       ; Download does not pop up
                       'profile.default_content_settings.popups': 0,
                       ; No popup
                       'profile.default_content_setting_values': {'notifications': 2},
                       ; Disable PDF plugin

### OptionsManager Object

The OptionsManager object is used to read, set and save the configuration.

```python
get_value(section, item) - > str  # Get the value of a configuration
get_option(section) - > dict  # Return all attributes of configuration in dictionary format
set_item(section, item, value)  # Set configuration attributes
save()  # Save the configuration to the default ini file
save('D:\\settings.ini')  # save to other path
```



### Usage example

```python
from DrissionPage.configs import *

options_manager = OptionsManager()  # Create OptionsManager object from the default ini file
options_manager = OptionsManager('D:\\settings.ini')  # Create OptionsManager object from other ini files
driver_path = options_manager.get_value('paths','chromedriver_path')  # read path information
options_manager.save()  # Save to the default ini file
options_manager.save('D:\\settings.ini')  # save to other path

drission = Drission(ini_path ='D:\\settings.ini')  # Use other ini files to create objects
```

**Note**: If you do not pass in the path when saving, it will be saved to the ini file in the module directory, even if the read is not the default ini file.



## easy_set method

Calling the easy_set method will modify the content of the default ini file.

```python
set_headless(True)  # Turn on headless mode
set_no_imgs(True)  # Turn on no image mode
set_no_js(True)  # Disable JS
set_mute(True)  # Turn on mute mode
set_user_agent('Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Int......')  # set user agent
set_proxy('127.0.0.1:8888')  # set proxy
set_paths(paths)  # See [Initialization] section
set_argument(arg, value)  # Set the attribute. If the attribute has no value (such as'zh_CN.UTF- 8'), the value is bool, which means switch; otherwise, the value is str. When the value is'' or False, delete the attribute item
```

## DriverPage and SessionPage

If you don't need to switch modes, you can only use DriverPage or SessionPage as needed, and the usage is the same as MixPage.

```python
from DrissionPage.session_page import SessionPage
from DrissionPage.drission import Drission

session = Drission().session
page = SessionPage(session)  # Pass in Session object
page.get('http://www.baidu.com')
print(page.ele('@id:su').text)  # Output: Baidu

driver = Drission().driver
page = DriverPage(driver)  # Pass in Driver object
page.get('http://www.baidu.com')
print(page.ele('@id:su').text)  # Output: Baidu
```
